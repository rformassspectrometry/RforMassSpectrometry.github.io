The aim of the *RforMassSpectrometry* initiative is to provide
efficient, thoroughly documented, tested, interoperable and flexible R
software for the analysis and interpretation of high throughput mass
spectrometry assays, including proteomics and metabolomics
experiments. The project formalises the longtime collaborative
development efforts of its core members under the
*RforMassSpectrometry* organisation to facilitate dissemination and
accessibility of their work.
